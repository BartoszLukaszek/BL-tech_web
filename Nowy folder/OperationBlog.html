          <p class="OperationText">
            Operation Bravo featured a playlist of 7 new maps (and one returning
            from Operation Payback) from the Steam Workshop. Unlike Operation
            Payback, these maps were playable for casual, competitive, and
            Deathmatch scenarios. A new addition to this operation included
            "Operation weapon finishes". There are two new weapon collections:
            The Alpha Collection available exclusively as individual all-map
            weapon drops to Bravo pass-holders, and the Bravo Collection
            available to everybody as part of the Bravo weapon case, also
            available through timed all-map drops. (Pass-buyers were able to get
            Bravo case drops in addition to regular drops) The Winter Offensive
            Update updates the Operation with two more maps.

          <p class="OperationText">
            Operation Wildfire also introduced new Blitz missions, where players
            earned bonus XP for performing specific actions during global
            windows of opportunity. Players must be Private Rank 3 or above to
            participate in competitive Blitz missions. The seven chosen maps
            were available for free to all players on official servers, but the
            reintroduction of Nuke remains on official servers.

          <p class="OperationText">
            Operation Shattered Web features a battle pass format, and Operation
            Rewards are earned when player receive enough stars to reach the
            next reward requirement. For example, if the player currently have
            20 stars and the next reward is available at 22 stars, you will need
            two more stars for your next reward. A player can purchase stars or
            earn them by completing missions.
